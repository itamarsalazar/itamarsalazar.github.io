After that I attended some short courses about neuroscience and I have become interested in the field and in the brain. I made a master in which I explored some techniques to solve the EEG inverse problem (MNE, WMNE, FOCUSS, MFOCUSS and Multiple Sparse Priors), I manipulated EEG recordings taken during attention tasks (P300 waves) using SPM software. During the last year I have been using CNNs in different problems like image or video classifications. I observed that current AI techniques have some problems manipulating ”the unknown” in classification tasks (a.k.a openset problem) and that are vulnerable to small changes (adversarial examples).

In this work, a CNN architecture (LinkNet) was trained to solve the isolated leaf segmentation problem under natural conditions. To do so, an open dataset has been modified and augmented, using rotations, shearing, and artificial illumination changes, in order to have a proper amount of imagery for training and validation. We have tested the CNN in two different datasets. The first belongs to the original open dataset that shares some visual characteristics with training and validation dataset. The second one contained its own imagery from a different set (images from different plants and with different illumination conditions) in order to evaluate the CNN model generalization. We obtained a mean Intersection Over Union (IoU) value of 0.90 for the first test and a 0.92 for the second one. An analysis of these results has been made and some problems regarding classification applications were commented.","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Leaf Segmentation from Images Taken Under Uncontrolled Conditions Using Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Morales Giorgio","Salazar-Reque I F","Telles Joel","Diaz Daniel"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Therefore, the contribution of this paper is twofold. The presentation of a video dataset called UNI-Crime, and the proposal of a violent robbery detection method in CCTV videos using a deep-learning sequence model. Each of the 30 frames of our videos passes through a pre-trained VGG-16 feature extractor; then, all the sequence of features is processed by two convolutional long-short term memory (convLSTM) layers; finally, the last hidden state passes through a series of fully-connected layers in order to obtain a single classification result. The method is able to detect a variety of violent robberies (i.e., armed robberies involving firearms or knives, or robberies showing different level of aggressiveness) with an accuracy of 96.69%.","tags":[],"title":"Detecting Violent Robberies in CCTV Videos Using Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salazar-Reque I F","Pacheco Adison","Rodriguez Ricardo","Lezama Jinmy","Huaman Samuel"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, nutrient deficiencies and plague attacks during cultivation stages represent a major difficulty for farmers since early identification of these states (i.e. deficiencies and plagues) is a time-consuming activity that requires trained evaluators to do so. In this paper, an automatic method for identification of avocado leaf state is proposed. This method uses k-means, in a s-v space at superpixel level, to segment leaf from uniform background from images captured in-field in semi-controlled conditions and a shallow neural network to classify composed histograms from segmented leaves into 4 states. Healthy, Fe deficiency, Mg deficiency and red spider plague. The proposed method separates leaf from background with an average F-score of 0.98 and classifies leaf condition with an overall accuracy of 96.8%.","tags":[],"title":"An image processing method to automatically identify Avocado leaf state","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

It is, however, a time-consuming and very subjective manual procedure whose automation is, therefore, highly expected. This work proposes a new method for the automatic segmentation of diseased leaf areas. The method used the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to group similar-color pixels together into regions called superpixels. The color features of superpixel clusters were used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the classification of superpixels as healthy or not healthy. These network parameters were heuristically tuned by choosing the network with the best classification performance to obtain the automatic segmentation of the diseased areas. The performance of the classifier was measured by comparing its automatic segmentations with those manually made from a database with public and private images divided into nine groups by visual symptom and plant. The mean error of the area obtained was always below 11%, and the average F-score was 0.67, which is higher than that found by the other two approaches reported in the literature (0.57 and 0.58) and used here for comparison.","tags":[],"title":"An Algorithm for Plant Disease Visual Symptom Detection in Digital Images Based on Superpixels","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
